# Exercise 13

## RGB To Hex Conversion

The rgb function is incomplete. Complete it so that passing in RGB decimal values will result in a hexadecimal representation being returned. Valid decimal values for RGB are 0 - 255. Any values that fall out of that range must be rounded to the closest valid value.

Note: Answer should always be 6 characters long, the shorthand with 3 will not work here.
